The Key Insight:
Life Blueprint Categories are your ongoing areas of identity/mastery, while Quests are specific transformations with endpoints.
This is actually the difference between:

Who you're becoming (Categories)
What you're achieving (Quests)

I think you need BOTH, but they serve different purposes:
Life Blueprint Categories (Permanent, Identity-Level)
These are your life domains - they never go away:

Health & Fitness
Relationships
Career/Mission
Financial Life
Spiritual Life
etc.

For each category, you define:

Vision - Who am I in this area? What does mastery look like?
Vision Board/Inspiration Gallery - Permanent images that embody this area
Purpose/Values - Why this area matters to me
Current Active Quests - What specific transformations am I pursuing now?
Completed Quests - History of wins in this area
Ongoing Routines - Daily/weekly practices that maintain this area

The Vision Board here is PERMANENT - it represents your ongoing identity in this domain.
Quests (Temporary, Goal-Level)
These are specific, measurable transformations with clear endpoints:

"Lose 30 pounds by April 15"
"Run a marathon by October"
"Earn $10K/month by December"
"Complete marriage intensive program"

For each Quest:

Result (RPM) - Specific outcome
Purpose (RPM) - Why it matters (with trigger words)
Daily Manifestation Practice - Vivid sensory visualization
Manifestation Gallery - Images specific to THIS quest
MAP - Tasks, routines, milestones
Limiting Beliefs - What blocks THIS quest?
Hero Council - Mentors for THIS quest

The Manifestation Gallery here is TEMPORARY - once you achieve it, these images move to your "wins" or the Quest gets archived.
The Relationship:
LIFE BLUEPRINT CATEGORY: Health & Fitness
├── Vision: "I am a strong, energetic, vibrant person who moves with ease"
├── Permanent Vision Board: [Athletic lifestyle images, healthy food, energy]
├── Purpose: "Because I want to play with my grandkids, feel confident, live to 100"
│
├── ACTIVE QUESTS:
│   ├── Quest: "Lose 30 lbs by April 15"
│   │   └── Manifestation Gallery: [Your target body, specific clothes, beach photos]
│   │
│   └── Quest: "Run first 10K by June 1"
│       └── Manifestation Gallery: [Crossing finish line, medal, celebration]
│
├── COMPLETED QUESTS:
│   └── Quest: "Completed Whole30 challenge" ✓
│
└── ONGOING ROUTINES:
    ├── Morning walk
    ├── Gym 3x/week
    └── Meal prep Sundays
Why This Works:

Categories give you the "why" at identity level - "I am a healthy person"
Quests give you the "what" at achievement level - "I will lose 30 pounds"
Category vision boards inspire the lifestyle - aspirational, ongoing
Quest manifestation galleries anchor specific results - concrete, temporary

User Workflow:

Foundation Section (one-time setup, occasional revision):

Life Purpose
Core Values
Life Blueprint Categories (with visions and permanent vision boards)
Overall Limiting Beliefs


Quests (ongoing creation and completion):

User creates Quest WITHIN a Category
"Which area of life is this Quest in?"
Quest inherits some context from Category but has its own specific manifestation
When completed, Quest archives but Category remains


Daily Practice:

Morning routine might include:

Quick review of Category visions (identity reinforcement)
Deep manifestation practice for 1-2 active Quests (specific outcomes)


Throughout day: Execute Quest MAPs
Evening: Review progress, journal insights



The Obsessed Health User:
Someone who gets "really into Health" would:

Have a rich, detailed Health & Fitness Category with elaborate vision board
Run multiple simultaneous Quests in that category (weight loss, strength gain, flexibility, nutrition)
Their Category vision board shows the overall healthy lifestyle
Each Quest's manifestation gallery shows specific milestones

When they complete a Quest (hit target weight), they:

Archive the Quest (with celebration!)
The Category remains active
They can create a new Quest in that category
The Category vision board keeps them connected to the identity even between Quests

So keep your Foundation section, but make it clear:

Foundation = Who you're becoming (permanent)
Quests = What you're achieving (temporary transformations)
